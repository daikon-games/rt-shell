## Setup

Integrating rt-shell into your project is simple: just [download the latest release](https://github.com/daikon-games/rt-shell/releases), and then in GameMaker Studio click on the **Tools** menu and select **Import Local Package**. Choose the `.yymps` file you downloaded, and import all assets.

Alternatively you can install rt-shell from the [Game Maker Marketplace](https://marketplace.yoyogames.com/assets/9485/rt-shell).

The `obj_shell` object is a persistent object, so you only need to include or create it once, though it is smart enough to automatically handle excess instances. The default way to open the shell is `Ctrl + Shift + C`, and it can be closed by pressing `Esc`.

## Writing Your Own Shell Commands

rt-shell will execute any global scripts whose names start with `sh_`. You can see the example scripts included with the test project in [`scr_shell_scripts.gml`](rt-shell/scripts/scr_shell_scripts/scr_shell_scripts.gml).

Let's write a simple "Hello World" commands together. We first need a place to create the function, so create a Script asset in your project. The name of this asset isn't important, but we can call it `scr_shell_scripts` as I have done in the test project.

Now let's write our function! We want it to take an argument as input, and print "Hello [argument]!" to the console. Like so:

![A "Hello World" example](images/helloworld-example.png)

Our function needs to start with `sh_`, so let's call it `sh_say_greeting`. As you can see in the example screenshot above, you do not include the `sh_` when calling the function.

rt-shell functions take an array called `args` as an argument, and any arguments passed to the function at the console are present in this array in GML. `args[0]` always contains the name of the function, as in typical shell programming, and `args[1]` and onwards are the real arguments passed in.

rt-shell functions can optionally return a string, and if they do that string will be printed to the console.

With all that said, here's our final hello world function:

```gml
function sh_say_greeting (args) {
	return "Hello " + args[1] + "!";
}
```

Simple, right? With that function in place, you can call `say_greeting` from the shell as you saw in the screenshot above.

If you want to pass a string with spaces in it as a single argument, you can surround that argument with double quotes, like so: `say_greeting "Mr and Mrs Fox!"`, which would return `Hello Mr and Mrs Fox!`.

I'm sure you can think of all sorts of commands that would come in handy for debugging and testing your game. How about a script that set's the player's max health, or money counter? A script that spawns an enemy or a treasure item? Experiment and have fun, happy developing!

## Adding Command Metadata

rt-shell provides a way for you to add metadata to your commands. This will let you see possible arguments and autocomplete suggestions within the shell, as well as let you plug into the shell's built-in `help` commands to document your own functions!

Adding metadata works much the same way as adding your custom commands in the first place. You simply create a new function that begins with `meta_` followed by the name of your function. For instance, if you had a function `sh_create_balloon` then you could add metadata by creating another function `meta_create_balloon`. The part of the name after `sh_` and after `meta_` must match exactly for them to be linked.

Let's say that `sh_create_balloon` looked like this:
```gml
function sh_create_balloon (args) {
	var balloon = instance_create_layer(args[1], args[2], "balloon_layer", obj_balloon);
	balloon.type = args[3];
	balloon.color = args[4];
}
```

You can see that it takes four arguments: X/Y coordinates and two arguments defining a type and color. We can then make an associated metadata function. Every metadata function should return a struct with a specific format, as you can see:
```gml
function meta_create_balloon() {
	return {
		description: "create a balloon",
		arguments: ["x", "y", "type", "color"],
		suggestions: [
			[],
			[],
			["normal", "animal_dog", "animal_snake"],
			function() {
				var _colors = [];
				// some code that fetches a dynamic list of available colors here
				return _colors;
			}
		],
		argumentDescriptions: [
			"the X coordinate to create the balloon at",
			"the Y coordinate to create the balloon at",
			"the type of balloon to create",
			"the color of the balloon"
		],
		hidden: false
	}
}
```
When you go to type your script into the shell your argument hints will show up like so:

![argument hints](images/argument_hints.png)

and so will your autocompletion suggestions:

![suggestions](images/suggestions.png)

The command will also display the arguments and description fields when running `help create_balloon`.

Some things to keep in mind:

1. The function names must match after the `sh_` and `meta_` prefixes.
2. The order of the array items in `arguments`, `suggestions`, and `argumentDescriptions` must line up
3. If suggestions aren't needed for an argument (like for `x` or `y` above), just input a blank array `[]`
4. Each of the items inside `suggestions` can be either a static array of possible suggestions, or a function that returns an array. If you use a function, it will be called at run-time, making the suggestions dynamic!
5. `description` and `argumentDescriptions` are optional, they're only used for the `help` output
6. `hidden` is optional, but if `hidden` is set to `true`, the function will not appear in the help output, or in autocomplete suggestions! This way you can add secret cheat codes. You will still be able to type `help hidden_function_name` and see help output, but only if you know that hidden function's name in the first place.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

In the shell, there are a number of useful keyboard shortcuts. These are all triggered using the Meta-key which by default is Control, but can be altered (see [Configuring rt-shell](#configuring-rt-shell))

| Key Combo | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Meta-key + A | Move cursor to the start of the line |
| Meta-key + E | Move cursor to the end of the line |
| Meta-key + Left Arrow | Move cursor left one word (separated by spaces) |
| Meta-key + Right Arrow | Move cursor right one word (separated by spaces) |
| Meta-key + Backspace | Delete from the cursor backwards to the preceding space |
| Meta-key + K | Delete forward from the cursor to the end of the line, and store the deleted text on a clipboard (this is equivalent to GNU-style "kill", but our clipboard only stores one thing rather than a ring) |
| Meta-key + Y | Insert previously "killed" text at the cursor position (this is equivalent to GNU-style "yank", but our clipboard only stores one thing rather than a ring ) |
| Meta-key + C | Abort the current command. This will put the aborted command into the output history, but not execute it, and will return your shell to a blank input |

## Configuring rt-shell

The following variables on the `obj_shell` object can be configured. They are defined on the object's `Variable Definitions` panel in the IDE. It is recommended that you instantiate `obj_shell` programatically and then set these parameters on the created instance via code. This way you can upgrade to a newer version of rt-shell without having to re-configure your shell object!

### Appearance Configuration
